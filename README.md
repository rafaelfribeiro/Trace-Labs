# Trace-Labs
Welcome to Ethereum transactions crawler task

# First steps
 - Clone / Download project
 - Go to the path and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
 
# Run the project!
 - Open terminal/cmd in path
 - I recommend to run in development to raise errors in case that occur. So:
 - - ( Windows ) - run ```SET FLASK_ENV=development```
 - - ( linux ) - run ```export FLASK_ENV=development```
 - Then just run the project ```flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80```

 OBS.: In case you have Apache runnig or other program using ```port 80``` you can just try run in ```--port=801``` or another one.
